## About project
TrendCart is a dynamic and user-friendly e-commerce website that offers a wide range of products to its customers. Powered by a robust backend, the platform utilizes various packages like "bcryptjs" for secure password encryption, "cloudinary" for efficient image management, and "stripe" for smooth and secure payment transactions.

The frontend of TrendCart is built using cutting-edge technologies such as React for seamless user interactions, while "react-redux" ensures smooth state management. The website's attractive design is enriched by components from "@headlessui/react" and "@heroicons/react," providing an engaging and intuitive user experience.

TrendCart allows admins to easily manage the inventory by adding products, specifying their brand, size, color, and category. To protect sensitive actions and data, JWT (JSON Web Tokens) are used for token-based authentication and verification, ensuring a safe and secure user experience.
